## LeetCode Solutions
This repository serves as a collection of **_my own personal solutions created without looking at the solution_** to various problems on [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/).
As such, some of these solutions are not to be considered the most optimal approach but an initial attempt 
that passed all test cases at the given time of upload. As my technical acumen develops,
I shall be updating this repo to finish incomplete submissions and introduce solutions to increasingly difficult problems.
My motivation in doing these problems is to become aware and appreciate all of the elegant algorithmic techniques and 
data storage abstractions that were engineered to make a computer operate seamlessly.
